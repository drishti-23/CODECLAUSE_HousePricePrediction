**House price prediction model** is used to predict house price with the help of the Regression(Supervised Machine Learning)techinique. This technique works on the equation y=mx+c, where Y is the dependent variable and which is the *House Price* and X is the independent value which is like example area, size of the house. 
So here I have used linear regression (which is mainly used for displaying this model). I have also used tensorflow techniques like keras to plot the  model and show more clear and deep layer wise discription in the form of graphs and images.

**The task given by the company was to -** 
Build a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on features like the number of bedrooms and square footage.

the main code for checking the price is at the end, in which under user_data there are attributes that a user wants accordingly. 
Under **user_data** you can fill the numbers of the particular attributes you want and it will give the predicted out as per the choices that the user have made.

Here I have added every attributes in the user_data as becuase the function needs an array for size 7.
But at the end under num_vars I have added only those attributes on which I want to get the price of the house. 
So here I have used bedrooms, area and price as a attributes to get the predicted price accordingly you can add more attributes which I have as a cooment just next to it if you need them.
